flow (steps to take):

1/install all the dependencies on your terminal
2/download the model file(model-resnet50-final3.h5), playtrack files(wav.)
3/run the try5.py (main file)


How to test (at least 3 ways):


1/There will pop up a drop box for you to input any image that has a single cat/snake/dog on it, 
after inputting, the image will appear on the pygame interface thus starting the pygame, with a printing 
line of "I am lonely. I need you." A clear playtrack of dog bark, cat meowing will also be there. 
(Plus, you can also try a blurry picture of cat/dog/snake, I have tested some successfully, but 
however not guaranteed with a accuracy as high as those with the normal images.)

2/The functions appear on the screen would be the three unique to cats (collect furs, clean litter 
and feed the treats); dogs: Feed Bone", "Walk Dog", "Hug Dog"; and snakes: "Feed Rats", "Clean Ecdysis",
"Curl Up Gently".

3/when you click any of the actions to interact with the pet, the printing line on top of the 
interface will change to "I love you, I will always be your side, my human.", with a happier sound of pets different
from before (except snake).

4/close the pygame, and when you input another image, the pygame will start a new one of the new image.
