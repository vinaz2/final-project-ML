***Flow (Steps to run my program)***

1. install all the dependencies on your terminal (see requirements_dependencies.txt);

2. git clone this repo (typing command "git clone https://github.com/vinaz2/final-project-ml");

(There is a big file, the model file, so then you should only get the files by git clone. Downloading the files directly from github website will cause the model file to be html format, not the Hierarchical Data Format that the my model file is actually of.)

3. run the main_try5.py (this is the main file);

(Running it might take a bit of time for the drop-drag pops up, thanks for the patience~~~)



How to test (at least 3 ways):

1/ There will pop up a drop box for you to input any image that has a single cat/snake/dog on it. (
in addition, you can also play with the vague images that I provided in repo or internet, though not 
guaranteed with an efficiency as high as that with clear images)

2/ After inputting, the image will appear on the pygame interface thus starting the pygame, with a printing 
line of "I am lonely. I need you." A clear playtrack of dog bark, cat meowing will also be there. 

3/ The functions appear on the screen would be the three unique to cats (collect furs, clean litter 
and feed the treats); three unique to dogs: Feed Bone", "Walk Dog", "Hug Dog"; and three to snakes: 
"Feed Rats", "Clean Ecdysis", "Curl Up Gently".

4/ When you click any of the actions to interact with the pet, the printing line on top of the 
interface will change to "I love you, I will always be your side, my human.", with a happier sound of pets different
from before (except snake).

5/ Close the pygame, and when you input another image, the pygame will start a new one of the new image.
